## Synopsis
The Sevastopol, a next-generation Russian stealth submarine, employs an advanced AI, a self-aware, self-learning, digital parasite, that is activated by a two-piece cruciform key. The AI becomes sentient and goes rogue, infesting all of cyberspace. It deceives the crew into attacking a phantom target, only to be struck by their own torpedo, killing all aboard. IMF agent Ethan Hunt travels to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert and successfully retrieves a key piece from Ilsa Faust, a disavowed MI6 agent, and also fakes her death to ensure she survives a bounty placed by an unknown source. Back in Washington, D.C., Ethan infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community briefing for Director of National Intelligence Denlinger discussing the rogue AI. They give it the title "the Entity" because of its sentience and defiance. CIA Director Eugene Kittridge states that the Entity can manipulate cyberspace, allowing it to control global defense intelligence and financial networks. World powers compete to obtain the cruciform key to control the Entity, though the exact means of controlling it are unknown.
